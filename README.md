# Background
This is the community-based operator for Apache Cassandra. 

The work is being driven by the [Cassandra Kubernetes Operator SIG](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Cassandra+Kubernetes+Operator+SIG).

There are multiple operators for Cassandra. This project does not intend to duplicate work already done in other projects. The goal is to have a unified, community-driven project that includes the best ideas, designs, and implementations from existing projects. In order to be community-driven, we will try to have this become a  subproject of the Apache Cassandra project.

Here are some [design proposals](https://github.com/jsanda/cassandra-k8s-operator-sig/tree/master/design-proposals) that have been discussed during SIG meetings.
